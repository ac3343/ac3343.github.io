## Features

### Entering

The user can enter either a vocabulary word or a kanji character. For vocabulary, the user enters the hiragana or katakana, kanji, english meaning, and the part of speech. The part of speech options are nouns, na-adjectives, i-adjectives, u-verbs, ru-verbs, and irregular verbs. To enter kanji, the user enters the kanji itself, its on and kun readings, its stroke count, and its english meaning. Vocabulary and kanji entries are done on separate pages, with two separate buttons on the homepage for adding each. However, multiple entries of each type can be done at once. When an entry or group of entries is submitted, the submit time is saved along with it.

### Accessing

There are several buttons to access different types of words on the home page. The buttons include an all vocabulary button, a button for all parts of speech, and a button for kanji. These buttons take the user to a page that has a list of words or characters corresponding to the pressed button. On this page, vocabulary entries display their kanji form, their hiragana or katakana form, and their english meaning. Kanji entries show the kanji itself, its kun and on readings, its meaning in english, and its stroke count. Entries can be edited by pressing the edit button on it. They can also be deleted by pressing the delete button.
Both vocabulary and kanji lists can be sorted by oldest or newest. Only vocabulary lists, however, can be sorted in japanese alphabetical order. Each list can also be filtered. Filters include entries from the last week, the last two weeks, and the last month. The user can also search through each list using kanji, hiragana, katakana, or english characters. Kanji is found by searching for either its english meaning, its on reading, or its kun reading. Vocabulary words can be searched by their english meaning, the kanji version of the word, the katakana version, or the hiragana version.

### Studying

There are two ways to study entries with this application: the study random button and study selected button. The study random button is on the home page and enables the user to study random vocabulary or kanji entries. Pressing it takes them to the study settings page where they have various options for studying. They can select the type of entry they want to practice. The types include nouns, adjectives, na-adjectives, verbs, u-verbs, ru-verbs and irregular verbs. The user can choose the amount of random entries they want to practice or select all the entries in a category. The user can also select entries from a specific period of time. The selectable periods are the last week, the last two weeks, the last month, and the last six months. The user may configure the flashcards as well, having hiragana appear with either the kanji or the english meaning. The user can also choose which side they are presented with first.

The study selected button allows the user to manually choose which entries they wish to study. Entries can be selected while browsing the vocabulary and kanji lists. On the list pages and the homepage, the study selected button appears in the bottom right hand corner. Pressing it opens a lightbox menu that shows the selected entries and the flashcard settings from the previous study method. Here, unwanted entries can be removed, and the flashcard settings can be changed. Pressing the start button begins the study session.

Studying takes the form of flashcards, with one side having either kanji and hiragana or just kanji and the other side having just english or english and hiragana. The card can be flipped with the space button or with the up and down arrow keys. The right and left arrow keys switch between entries. Once the user has reached the end of the studied entries, they are given the option to either redo the entries in the same order or reshuffle them. The study page can be closed at any time by pressing the back button at the top left corner of the screen. This will take them back to the home screen.
